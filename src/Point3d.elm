{-| A `Point3d` represents a position in 3D space and is defined by its X, Y and
Z coordinates. This module contains a variety of point-related functionality,
such as

  - Measuring distance between points, or the distance of a point from an axis
    or a plane
  - Scaling, rotating, translating, mirroring and projecting points
  - Converting points between different coordinate systems

Points are distinct from vectors but interact with them in well-defined ways;
you can translate a point by a vector to result in a new point, or you can
compute the vector from one point to another, but you cannot 'add' two points
like you can add two vectors.

@docs Point3d


# Constants

@docs origin


# Literals

@docs unitless

The remaining functions all construct a `Point3d` from X, Y and Z coordinates
given in specific units. Functions like `Point3d.xyz` are more useful in generic
code, but these functions are useful for quickly creating hardcoded constant
values, e.g.

    point =
        Point3d.meters 2 3 1

These functions may also be useful when decoding points from JSON - for example
if you had some JSON where a point was encoded as an object with `x`, `y` and
`z` fields measured in meters then you could write a decoder like

    Decode.map3 Point3d.meters
        (Decode.field "x" Decode.float)
        (Decode.field "y" Decode.float)
        (Decode.field "z" Decode.float)

@docs meters, pixels, millimeters, centimeters, inches, feet


# Constructors

@docs xyz, xyzIn, midpoint, interpolateFrom, along, on, xyOn, rThetaOn, circumcenter


# Interop

These functions are useful for interoperability with other Elm code that uses
plain `Float` tuples or records to represent points.

@docs fromTuple, toTuple, fromRecord, toRecord


## Zero-copy conversions

These functions allow zero-overhead conversion of points to and from records
with `x`, `y` and `z` `Float` fields, useful for efficient interop with other
code that represents points as plain records.

@docs fromMeters, toMeters, fromPixels, toPixels, fromUnitless, toUnitless


# Properties

@docs coordinates, xCoordinate, yCoordinate, zCoordinate, coordinatesIn, xCoordinateIn, yCoordinateIn, zCoordinateIn


# Comparison

@docs equalWithin, lexicographicComparison


# Measurement

@docs distanceFrom, signedDistanceAlong, distanceFromAxis, signedDistanceFrom


# Transformations

@docs scaleAbout, rotateAround, translateBy, translateIn, mirrorAcross, projectOnto, projectOntoAxis


# Unit conversions

@docs at, at_


# Coordinate conversions

@docs relativeTo, placeIn, projectInto


# Centroid calculation

@docs centroid, centroidOf, centroid3, centroidN


# Advanced

These functions are unsafe because they require you to track units manually. In
general you should prefer other functions instead, but these functions may be
useful when writing generic/library code.
