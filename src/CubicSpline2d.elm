{-| A `CubicSpline2d` is a cubic [Bézier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)
in 2D defined by a start point, end point and two control points. This module
contains functionality for

  - Constructing splines
  - Evaluating points and tangent directions along a spline
  - Scaling, rotating, translating or mirroring a spline
  - Converting a spline between local and global coordinates in different
    reference frames

# Properties

@docs startPoint, endPoint, startControlPoint, endControlPoint, startDerivative, endDerivative, boundingBox


# Evaluation

## Low level

An `ArcLengthParameterized` value is a combination of an
[`ArcLengthParameterization`](Geometry-ArcLengthParameterization) and an
underlying `CubicSpline2d`. If you need to do something fancy, you can extract
these two values separately.

@docs arcLengthParameterization, fromArcLengthParameterized


# Differentiation

You are unlikely to need to use these functions directly, but they are useful if
you are writing low-level geometric algorithms.
