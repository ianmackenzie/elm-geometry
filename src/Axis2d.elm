{-| An `Axis2d` represents an infinitely long straight line in 2D and is defined
by an origin point and direction. Axes have several uses, such as:

  - Mirroring across the axis
  - Projecting onto the axis
  - Measuring distance along the axis from the origin point

{-| Construct an axis with the given direction, through the given origin point.
Flipped version of `through`. Having both versions allow you to do different
things with partial application:

    -- A list of axes in different directions all passing
    -- through the same origin point
    List.map (Axis2d.through point) directions

    -- A list of parallel axes (all having the same
    -- direction) through different points
    List.map (Axis2d.withDirection direction) points
