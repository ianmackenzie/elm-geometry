{-| A `BoundingBox2d` is a rectangular box in 2D defined by its minimum and
maximum X and Y values. It is possible to generate bounding boxes for most
geometric objects; for example, [`Triangle2d.boundingBox`](Triangle2d#boundingBox)
takes a `Triangle2d` and returns a `BoundingBox2d` that contains that triangle.
There are several use cases where it is more efficient to deal with the bounding
box of an object than the object itself, such as:

  - Intersection checking: If (for example) the bounding boxes of a line segment
    and a triangle do not overlap, then the line segment and triangle cannot
    possibly intersect each other. Expensive intersection checking therefore
    only has to be performed for line segments and triangles whose bounding
    boxes _do_ overlap.
  - 2D rendering: When rendering a 2D scene, any object whose bounding box does
    not overlap the viewing area must itself be completely outside the viewing
    area, and therefore does not have to be drawn. This provides a simple form
    of culling.
