{-| A `BoundingBox2d` is a rectangular box in 2D defined by its minimum and
maximum X and Y values. It is possible to generate bounding boxes for most
geometric objects; for example, [`Triangle2d.boundingBox`](Triangle2d#boundingBox)
takes a `Triangle2d` and returns a `BoundingBox2d` that contains that triangle.
There are several use cases where it is more efficient to deal with the bounding
box of an object than the object itself, such as:

  - Intersection checking: If (for example) the bounding boxes of a line segment
    and a triangle do not overlap, then the line segment and triangle cannot
    possibly intersect each other. Expensive intersection checking therefore
    only has to be performed for line segments and triangles whose bounding
    boxes _do_ overlap.
  - 2D rendering: When rendering a 2D scene, any object whose bounding box does
    not overlap the viewing area must itself be completely outside the viewing
    area, and therefore does not have to be drawn. This provides a simple form
    of culling.

{-| Check if one box overlaps another by less than, greater than or equal to a
given amount. For example, you could implement a tolerant collision check (one
that only returns true if the boxes overlap by at least some small finite
amount, and ignores boxes that just barely touch each other) as

    boxesCollide box1 box2 =
        BoundingBox2d.overlappingBy GT 0.001 box1 box2

This can be read as "`box1` and `box2` are overlapping by greater than 0.001
units". (The [`Order`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Basics#Order)
type and its three values `LT`, `GT` and `EQ` are defined in Elm's `Basics`
module so are available by default in any Elm program.)

Overlap is defined as the _minimum_ distance one box would have to move so that
it did not touch the other, and is always positive for any two overlapping
boxes.

Boxes that just touch are considered to have an overlap of zero, which is
distinct from 'no overlap'. Boxes that do not touch or overlap at all are
considered to have an overlap which is less than zero but not comparable to any
negative number.


### Less than

  - `overlappingBy LT 1e-3` will return true if the two boxes overlap by less
    than 0.001 units or if they do not overlap at all (false if they overlap by
    more than 0.001 units).
  - `overlappingBy LT 0` will return true only if the two boxes don't touch or
    overlap at all.
  - `overlappingBy LT -1e-3` will always return false! If you care about _how
    much_ two boxes are separated by, use `separatedBy` instead.


### Greater than

  - `overlappingBy GT 1e-3` will return true if the two boxes overlap by at
    least 0.001 units (false if they overlap by less than that or do not overlap
    at all).
  - `overlappingBy GT 0` will return true if the two boxes overlap by any
    non-zero amount (false if they just touch or do not overlap at all).
  - `overlappingBy GT -1e-3` doesn't make a lot of sense but will return true if
    the boxes touch or overlap at all (false if they don't overlap, regardless
    of how close they are to overlapping). In this case, though, it would make
    more sense to just user `intersects` instead.


### Equal to

Checking whether two boxes overlap by exactly a given amount is pretty weird and
vulnerable to floating-point roundoff, but is defined as follows:

  - `overlappingBy EQ 1e-3` will return true if the two boxes overlap by exactly
    0.001 units.
  - `overlappingBy EQ 0` will return true if and only if the boxes just touch
    each other.
  - `overlappingBy EQ -1e-3` will always return false.
