This module contains a variety of point-related functionality,\nsuch as\n\n  - Measuring distance between points, or the distance of a point from an axis\n    or a plane\n  - Scaling, rotating, translating, mirroring and projecting points\n  - Converting points between different coordinate systems\n\nPoints are distinct from vectors but interact with them in well-defined ways;\nyou can translate a point by a vector to result in a new point, or you can\ncompute the vector from one point to another, but you cannot 'add' two points\nlike you can add two vectors.\n\n@docs Point3d\n\n\n# Constants\n\n@docs origin\n\n\n# Literals\n\n@docs unitless\n\nThe remaining functions all construct a `Point3d` from X, Y and Z coordinates\ngiven in specific units. Functions like `Point3d.xyz` are more useful in generic\ncode, but these functions are useful for quickly creating hardcoded constant\nvalues, e.g.\n\n    point =\n        Point3d.meters 2 3 1\n\n@docs meters, pixels, millimeters, centimeters, inches, feet\n\n\n# Constructors\n\n@docs xyz, xyzIn, midpoint, interpolateFrom, along, on, xyOn, rThetaOn, circumcenter\n\n\n# Interop\n\nThese functions are useful for interoperability with other Elm code that uses\nplain `Float` tuples or records to represent points.\n\n@docs fromTuple, toTuple, fromRecord, toRecord\n\n\n## Zero-copy conversions\n\nThese functions allow zero-overhead conversion of points to and from records\nwith `x`, `y` and `z` `Float` fields, useful for efficient interop with other\ncode that represents points as plain records.\n\n@docs fromMeters, toMeters, fromPixels, toPixels, fromUnitless, toUnitless\n\n\n# Properties\n\n@docs coordinates, xCoordinate, yCoordinate, zCoordinate, coordinatesIn, xCoordinateIn, yCoordinateIn, zCoordinateIn\n\n\n# Comparison\n\n@docs equalWithin, lexicographicComparison\n\n\n# Measurement\n\n@docs distanceFrom, signedDistanceAlong, distanceFromAxis, signedDistanceFrom\n\n\n# Transformations\n\n@docs scaleAbout, rotateAround, translateBy, translateIn, mirrorAcross, projectOnto, projectOntoAxis\n\n\n# Unit conversions\n\n@docs at, at_\n\n\n# Coordinate conversions\n\n@docs relativeTo, placeIn, projectInto\n\n\n# Centroid calculation\n\n@docs centroid, centroidOf, centroid3, centroidN\n\n\n# Advanced\n\nThese functions are unsafe because they require you to track units manually. In\ngeneral you should prefer other functions instead, but these functions may be\nuseful when writing generic/library code.\n\n@docs unsafe, unwrap\n\n","unions":[],"aliases":[{"name":"Point3d","comment":" ","args":["units","coordinates"],"type":"Geometry.Types.Point3d units coordinates"}],"values":[{"name":"along","comment":" Construct a point along an axis at a particular distance from the axis'\norigin point.\n\n    Point3d.along Axis3d.z (Length.meters 2)\n    --> Point3d.meters 0 0 2\n\nPositive and negative distances are interpreted relative to the direction of the\naxis:\n\n    horizontalAxis =\n        Axis3d.withDirection Direction3d.negativeX\n            (Point3d.meters 1 1 1)\n\n    Point3d.along horizontalAxis (Length.meters 3)\n    --> Point3d.meters -2 1 1\n\n    Point3d.along horizontalAxis (Length.meters -3)\n    --> Point3d.meters 4 1 1\n\n","type":"Geometry.Types.Axis3d units coordinates -> Quantity.Quantity Basics.Float units -> Point3d.Point3d units coordinates"},{"name":"at","comment":" Convert a point from one units type to another, by providing a conversion factor given as a\nrate of change of destination units with respect to source units.\n\n    worldPoint =\n        Point3d.meters 2 3 1\n\n    resolution : Quantity Float (Rate Pixels Meters)\n    resolution =\n        Pixels.pixels 100 |> Quantity.per (Length.meters 1)\n\n    worldPoint |> Point3d.at resolution\n    --> Point3d.pixels 200 300 100\n\n","type":"Quantity.Quantity Basics.Float (Quantity.Rate destinationUnits sourceUnits) -> Point3d.Point3d sourceUnits coordinates -> Point3d.Point3d destinationUnits coordinates"},{"name":"at_","comment":" Convert a point from one units type to another, by providing an 'inverse' conversion factor\ngiven as a rate of change of source units with respect to destination units.\n\n    screenPoint =\n        Point3d.pixels 200 300 100\n\n    resolution : Quantity Float (Rate Pixels Meters)\n    resolution =\n        Pixels.pixels 50 |> Quantity.per (Length.meters 1)\n\n    screenPoint |> Point3d.at_ resolution\n    --> Point3d.meters 4 6 2\n\n","type":"Quantity.Quantity Basics.Float (Quantity.Rate sourceUnits destinationUnits) -> Point3d.Point3d sourceUnits coordinates -> Point3d.Point3d destinationUnits coordinates"},{"name":"centimeters","comment":" ","type":"Basics.Float -> Basics.Float -> Basics.Float -> Point3d.Point3d Length.Meters coordinates"},{"name":"centroid","comment":" Find the centroid (average) of one or more points, by passing the first\npoint and then all remaining points.
